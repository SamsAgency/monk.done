            We, the Women of the Straight Black Pride Movement (SBPM) vehemently oppose the Forced Gender Conversion (FGC) of our young Black, Afrikan children.  We consider this behavior to be harmful to their natural development. <br/>We oppose all forms of Forced Gender Conversion (FGC) on Afrikan children including:
<ol type="i.">
    <li>	Dressing them as the complementary gender </li>
    <li>	Forcing them to be seen publicly in drag </li>
    <li>	Giving our sons girl names and our daughters boy names </li>
    <li>	Referring to them outside of their God-appointed gender designated at birth </li>
    <li>	Teaching them that they are other than their God-appointed gender designated at birth </li>
    <li>	Pushing them towards unnatural choices and lifestyles </li>
</ol>
    <p>
    Afrikan people throughout the Diaspora are the fruits of our Ancestors who were stolen from Afrika, and who endured innumerable atrocities for hundreds of years without any justice. This new age FGC is merely a continuation of the heinous, horrific evil that was forced on our Ancestors during slavery, and now this legacy continues on our children today.Imagine seeing whites being allowed to adopt Black children at their discretion.  Then under the guise of supposedly giving our children an even better life than we could give them, discovering the horrific truth that they are actually no better than their ancestors.  And instead of protecting and rearing our babies, they are taking our defenseless babies and victimizing them!<br/><br/>
    Imagine being a Black child confused about your natural gender at such a young age because your new parents (or captors in some cases) are “encouraging you to explore your gender identity.”  Meanwhile, these same “parents” are forcing you to go through a process that is aggressively interfering with your natural developmental stages in order to convert you to another gender. <br/><br> We have witnessed many instances over the past few years where small children are not being allowed to reach their full cognitive maturity before adults decide to interfere.  It is psychological torture and blatant child abuse!  It is especially evil because it is done under the guise that the young child is CHOOSING to be this way and it is unacceptable! As mothers, future mothers, grandmothers, aunties & sisters of Afrikan children, our Spirit cannot allow us to sit by any longer without appealing to every other Afrikan woman to recognize the assault being brought against the fruit of our wombs.
    </p>
    <image class="img-fluid" src="./assets/images/charlize theron 2 - little brother.jpg" style="max-height: 550px;">
    <br/><br/>Specifically to Charlize Theron, we oppose what we consider to be the psychological, emotional, and physical abuse forced upon our children.  It is clear that you are incapable of and have zero interest in rearing this boy to become the strong Afrikan man he was born to be. <br> It is also obvious that you are aware of the strong Afrikan manhood required to adequately respond to the centuries of atrocities committed against Afrikan people. Therefore, whether directly or indirectly your efforts will result in our son, freely given to you by the United States government, being rendered incapable of taking his rightful place as an Afrikan man in this world.  
    We believe the FGC of our Black children is an act of compliance with the overt homophile (homosexuality and pedophilia) agenda now spreading throughout the world.  We see the efforts to destroy Black manhood by turning our sons into your daughters as an aggressive act of racial genocide.  We and OUR ANCESTORS are aware of your treacherous intentions.
    <image class="img-fluid" src="./assets/images/charlize theron 12 - little brother.jpg" style="max-height: 550px;">
    <br>In closing, we want the Forced Gender Conversion (FGC) of our children to stop.  We would prefer for those who are sincere about helping our children to seek and find suitable Black couples and finance them to raise healthy Black children that will be a credit to our beautiful Black Race.

           <center><strong><i> “Verily wise Zeus carried off golden-haired Ganymedes because of his beauty, to be amongst the Deathless Ones and pour drink for the gods in the house of Zeus–a wonder to see–, honoured by all the immortals as he draws the red nectar from the golden bowl . . . deathless and unageing, even as the gods.”– Homeric Hymn 5 to Aphrodite 203 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th – 4th B.C.) </i> </strong><br/></center><br/><br/>
            In Greek Mythology, Ganymedes was the embodiment of beauty. He was a handsome, young Trojan who was, as Homer describes, “the most beautiful of mortals.” In the myth of Ganymedes and Zeus, Ganymedes is herding his flock on the mountainside when Zeus sees him and is determined to make Gaynmedes his lover. Zeus, in the form of an eagle, abducts the young Ganymedes and carries him off to Mount Olympus to be the god’s lover and cupbearer. Hera, Goddess of Women and Marriage, and wife of Zeus, upon hearing that Ganymedes was to be cupbearer as well as Zeus’ lover, became enraged with jealousy. Her own daughter Hebe, Goddess of Youth, previously held the favored position of cupbearer. The omnipotent Zeus did not waiver in his affection for Ganymedes who would carry a golden cup as he accompanied the powerful god on his travels. Eventually, Ganymedes, recognizing the thirst of the mortals, no longer coveted his role and, refusing his position as Zeus’ cupbearer, decided to pour out all the wine, ambrosia, and water of the gods. Although Zeus, a notoriously angry god, first wanted to punish Ganymedes, he eventually realized he had been unkind to the boy. Instead, Zeus set Ganymedes’ image among the stars as the constellation and God Aquarius, making him immortal and fulfilling Ganymedes wish of sending rain down to the people of the earth who were in need. This myth is often depicted through artwork of Ganymedes and an Eagle, or Ganymedes and Zeus, seen on canvas, pottery, and multiple other mediums of art.
            <br/>It is important to question why when reading about Ganymedes and Zeus the reader’s focus is on the beauty of the young male, not the actions of Zeus. If translated into common day form, with idols we recognize, people would be outraged. However, it is common to be taught various Greek myths in classrooms, which cover similar content. It is not viewed as pedophilia to us, however if it was rewritten without ties to an ancient culture, you could almost guarantee that if would be controversial. Foucault would link this to his repressive hypothesis. In the beginning of the “The History of Sexuality” Foucault claims:
            <br><center><strong><i>“Sexual practices had little need of secrecy; words were said without undue reticence, and things were done without too much concealment; one had a tolerant familiarity with the illicit” </i></strong></center>
            <br/>However, a very apparent switch was then made and sex was “moved into the home” where it could be carefully confined. It was restricted to simple procreation between a man and a woman. Other forms of sex were deviant and therefore not discussed. Except…
            <br/><center><strong><i>“If it was truly necessary to make room for illegitimate sexualities, it was reasoned, let them take their infernal mischief elsewhere: to a place where they could be reintegrated, if not in the circuits of production, at least in those of profit. The brothel and the mental hospital would be those places of tolerance: The prostitute, the client, and the pimp, together with the psychiatrist and his hysteric…”</i></strong></center>
            <br/>Non-heterosexual behavior was essentially demonized. The only place non-missionary between a man and a woman belonged was in a whorehouse or in a mental institute. Foucault would argue, in his repressive hypothesis, that since the rise of the bourgeoisie if Ganymedes and Zeus were to be rewritten it would be worthy of sending Zeus to a mental institution. Man has come to jail the actions of a God.
            <br/>It is impossible to know how the individual Greek from ancient times interpreted the actions of their Gods, however we can infer from the recurrent themes seen throughout the myths that pederasty was widely accepted. It is also impossible to know what the focus of the myth was intended to be. Logically, understanding that these myths were embodied through art and storytelling it would make sense to assume that beauty was a central focal point when sharing and preserving their culture. As mentioned earlier, if this myth were to be modernized, our repressed society would not focus on the beauty. However we still read Ganymedes and Zeus in a positive frame of light. The discrepancy is due to the common reader of Greek Mythology reading it in the vein in which it was written. This may be due to the cultural ties that come along with something that is not of our time-period. The only difference between the story of Zeus abducting a child and a Catholic priest and an altar boy is that the former is a remnant of a time period where people were not focused on the sexual acts that occurred and that sentiment carried through the generations of storytelling, keeping beauty the main focus.
            <br/><center><strong><i>“Thus the image of the imperial prude is emblazoned on our restrained, mute, and hypocritical sexuality.”</i></strong></center>

            Good day Parents. My name is Daniel Phaladi from the Back2God Campaign. I am also a father of 2 young boys who are still in primary school. Over the last couple of months I learnt of a great evil that is planned on our children. There is a curriculum called Comprehensive Sexuality Education (CSE) which is about to be unleashed on our children next year which has serious adverse and terrible consequences every single country or nation it was introduced.
            Now before I start, let me make one thing clear. Every Parent in South Africa we would love our children to be taught about Sexual Health at school as we will also be teaching our children sexual health in our homes. Sexual health teaches our children about the diseases and infections which are sexually transmitted, especially in South Africa with a high prevalence rate of HIV, it is important that our children are taught the right moral
            principles of abstinence till marriage, being faithful to one partner, and more than anything, teaching children the deep psychological impact of being raped, abused etc, and where to seek help. We have no problem with our children being taught these principles withing the Life Orientation subjects. However CSE is nothing even closely related to sexual health, CSE is about SEXUAL RIGHTS!! The United Nations calls it a "right based education".
        
        <br/><br/>  
            CSE takes away the moral values from children completely. It removes RIGHT AND WRONG, CSE says if it feels good, just do it as long as you put on a condom. CSE tries to normalize things to our children which are clearly not a society norm. Let me give you an example. We live in a free country, men who want to marry men are allowed to do so, women who want to marry other women are free to do so, it is a free country, the constitution gives everyone equal rights. Everyone can be with who they want to be with.
            However., the Government cannot take it upon themselves to teach my children about Male to Male pornography, and call it “normal”. The latest censors depict South Africa as 80% Christian and 1.7% Muslim. The other religions including Judaism, Satanism, Hinduism, Rastafarian, atheism etc make up the remaining 18%. The fact that 82% of this country subscribes to an “Abrahamic” religion, clearly shows the values, the ethos and the moral code most South Africans subscribe to. I am confident that the majority of parents in this country will never allow their children to be taught how “normal” it is for men to have sex with other men, women having sex with
            each other, and over and above that, being shown pornographic pictures of such.Research has shown that CSE has caused enormous damage to Parent/Child relationships everywhere it has been taught. Cases of STI’s have sky rocket, Abortions have increased, kids have been left disorientated not having any morals attached to sex, anything goes. The results of CSE is then a generation who have been sexualized at young age, many who go into depression, have low self esteem issues.
        
        <br/><br/>
        The following are MAIN REASONS why CSE should never be allowed to be taught in SA Schools.<br/><br/>
            1) UNESCO is an organization which has been pushing for sex education to be taught in schools at the United Nations. This bill which it has been bringing up to the United Nations since 2010 is backed by companies who manufacture contraceptives, it is also supported by “Planned Parenthood” groups as well as abortion clinics. This makes you realize the idea behind CSE is not to help our children, but abortion clinics are trying to increase their revenue.<br/><br/>

            2) There has not been sufficient consultative process. The Government wants to “sneak in” this curriculum. For example, many parents only became aware of this evil curriculum in April, they had no clue the Government is intending to alter the lives of their children FOREVER!! The Department of Basic Education had an insert on their website about CSE, and according to them, this was enough to alert parents of what is coming to their children. When we had elections earlier this year, the manifestos were broadcast on Radios 24/7,everyone knew what each party stands for, how come they did not just put an insert on their website, they went out and consulted the people, however with CSE the put a little writing on the website, we reject that completely.<br/> <br/>

            3) Teachers have not been trained. I have in my possession teachers training manuals which are meant to for teachers who will be teaching CSE in Southern Africa. I can assure you no teacher has seen that manual, yet teachers will be expected to teach CSE in school next year.<br/><br/>

            4) CSE tries to call evil good and good evil. They try to present sexually graphic pictures of behaviours which are perverse and deviant as progressive and “Modern”. We have seen the trend of late, where the curriculums at schools teach children about Darwinism (evolution), that there is no God, everything was created by random chance. They are teaching our children Pseudo science as fact. I have read a countless of submissions by world renowned professors who have PROVED that Darwinism is in fact.. not a scientificfact, but science fiction, yet there is a drive to say, if you believe in God you are a primitive, if you experiment with Yoga and other eastern religions you are then “modern”. Professor Ben Stein as well as multiple world renowned professors have absolutely scientifically proved what is called “Intelligent design” in other words, nothing was just randomly created, there was an intelligent designer behind creation. Many of those professors who submit Intelligent Design findings are fired immediately from institutions of learning.., so that the evil agenda can be pushed on learners. It is out time as parents to put an end to all these things..,<br/><br/>

            5) If we give in to CSE next year, the curriculum in the following years may expand to teach our children that their sexual behavior should not be limited to human beings, Children will be taught to be sexual with in-animate objects like tables, chairs.. and before we know it our children we be taught that it is “ok” and “normal” for them to have sex with animals, as long as they animal “consents” and it Is not hurt in the process. There is no telling of where the madness will stop. They have corrupted tenders, they have corrupted public institutions, they have corrupted State Owne Enterprises, now that they have run out of things to corrupt they are coming for our children. This is where they are going to know us as parents..this is where we put our foot down.<br/><br/>

            <strong>    Ancient Greece</strong>
            <br/>Pederasty in ancient Greece was a socially acknowledged romantic relationship between an adult male (the erastes) and a younger male (the eromenos) usually in his teens. It was characteristic of the Archaic and Classical periods.The influence of pederasty on Greek culture of these periods was so pervasive that it has been called "the principal cultural model for free relationships between citizens."Some scholars locate its origin in initiation ritual, particularly rites of passage on Crete, where it was associated with entrance into military life and the religion of Zeus. It has no formal existence in the Homeric epics, and seems to have developed in the late 7th century BC as an aspect of Greek homosocial culture, which was characterized also by athletic and artistic nudity, delayed marriage for aristocrats, symposia, and the social seclusion of women. Pederasty was both idealized and criticized in ancient literature and philosophy. The argument has recently been made that idealization was universal in the Archaic period; criticism began in Athens as part of the general Classical Athenian reassessment of Archaic culture. Scholars have debated the role or extent of pederasty, which is likely to have varied according to local custom and individual inclination. Athenian law, for instance, recognized both consent and age as factors in regulating sexual behavior. Enid Bloch argues that many Greek boys in these relationships may have been traumatized by knowing that they were violating social customs, since the "most shameful thing that could happen to any Greek male was penetration by another male." She further argues that vases showing "a boy standing perfectly still as a man reaches out for his genitals" indicate the boy may have been "psychologically immobilized, unable to move or run away". Other vases show the boy running away.
            
            <br/><br/><strong>  Ancient Rome</strong>
            <br/>In Latin, mos Graeciae or mos Graecorum ("Greek custom" or "the way of the Greeks") refers to a variety of behaviors the ancient Romans regarded as Greek, including but not confined to sexual practice. Homosexual behaviors at Rome were acceptable only within an inherently unequal relationship; male Roman citizens retained their masculinity as long as they took the active, penetrating role, and the appropriate male sexual partner was a prostitute or slave, who would nearly always be non-Roman. In Archaic and classical Greece, paiderasteia had been a formal social relationship between freeborn males; taken out of context and refashioned as the luxury product of a conquered people, pederasty came to express roles based on domination and exploitation. et passim Slaves often were given, and prostitutes sometimes assumed, Greek names regardless of their ethnic origin; the boys (pueri) to whom the poet Martial is attracted have Greek names. The use of slaves defined Roman pederasty; sexual practices were "somehow 'Greek'" when they were directed at "freeborn boys openly courted in accordance with the Hellenic tradition of pederasty".
            <br/>Effeminacy or a lack of discipline in managing one's sexual attraction to another male threatened a man's "Roman-ness" and thus might be disparaged as "Eastern" or "Greek". Fears that Greek models might "corrupt" traditional Roman social codes (the mos maiorum) seem to have prompted a vaguely documented law (Lex Scantinia) that attempted to regulate aspects of homosexual relationships between freeborn males and to protect Roman youth from older men emulating Greek customs of pederasty
            <br/>The Anglican Church of Canada notes that the Graeco-Roman "ideal" regarding homosexuality entailed erotic love of young (teenage) males of the same age that a young woman would be given in marriage, and that frequently the more mature male was only slightly older than the partner
